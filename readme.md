# SimpleEnvironment

Get-Server and other tools for working with a simple environment configuration, backed by a single JSON File.

Also a very rough example of using Format files!

The default environment file is `$Env:USERPROFILE/SimpleENV.json`, but you can set it in your profile with `Set-SimpleEnvConfiguration`.
